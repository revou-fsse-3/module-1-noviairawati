                <h1>Health Benefits of Fruits and Vegetables</h1>
                <img src="img/fruits1.jpg" alt="fruits">
                <p>Fruits and vegetables are universally promoted as healthy. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010
                    recommend you make one-half of your plate fruits and vegetables. Myplate.gov also supports that
                    one-half
                    the plate should be fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables include a diverse group of plant
                    foods
                    that vary greatly in content of energy and nutrients. Additionally, fruits and vegetables supply
                    dietary
                    fiber, and fiber intake is linked to lower incidence of cardiovascular disease and obesity. Fruits
                    and
                    vegetables also supply vitamins and minerals to the diet and are sources of phytochemicals that
                    function
                    as antioxidants, phytoestrogens, and antiinflammatory agents and through other protective
                    mechanisms. In
                    this review, we describe the existing dietary guidance on intake of fruits and vegetables. We also
                    review attempts to characterize fruits and vegetables into groups based on similar chemical
                    structures
                    and functions. Differences among fruits and vegetables in nutrient composition are detailed. We
                    summarize the epidemiological and clinical studies on the health benefits of fruits and vegetables.
                    Finally, we discuss the role of fiber in fruits and vegetables in disease prevention.</p>

            <h2>How Food Affects Health</h2>
            <p>Fruit is a high-quality carbohydrate that is rich in vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. The
                fiber
                in fruit comes in two forms — soluble and insoluble — and it can be a big help when it comes to weight
                loss.
                The soluble fiber in fruit stabilizes blood sugar, keeps you feeling full, controls your hunger, and it
                may
                also lower cholesterol and blood pressure. Plus, it helps to temper blood sugars by slowing the
                absorption
                of carbohydrates into your bloodstream after meals, which can reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes and
                help
                keep your mood and energy levels steady. Insoluble fiber adds bulk to your food so you can eat more of
                it
                without adding extra calories. You can also think of fruits as “juicy foods,” since they’re mostly made
                up
                of water. Fresh and frozen fruit and other foods that have a high water content tend to be low in
                calories,
                since all that water adds volume and dilutes the calories. The high fiber and water content in fresh
                fruit
                helps fill you up for a minimal calorie cost, making whole fruit a smart addition to any weight-loss
                plan.
                The water contained in fruit, like the water you drink, hydrates your cells, flushes toxins from your
                body,
                assists with normal organ functioning, and helps you maintain optimal energy levels. Fruit is especially
                beneficial for people fighting cardiovascular disease, as research suggests a diet rich in fruits and
                vegetables helps reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and coronary artery disease. Heads up — if
                you’re
                taking any cardiac medications (or any other medications, for that matter), it’s important to check with
                your physician or pharmacist to see if any of your meds interact with grapefruit. Compounds in
                grapefruit
                and grapefruit juice can affect how certain medications are absorbed and metabolized, so you’ll need to
                avoid grapefruit completely if directed by a health-care professional. Common nutrients in fruit include
                beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, folate, vitamins B6, C, and E, potassium, anthocyanins, and
                quercetin.

                        <p>One of the most noteworthy reasons to eat strawberries is to reap their possible antioxidant
                            benefits. Berries are among the most potent sources of antioxidants, according to an article
                            in
                            Nutrition Journal that sampled more than 3,100 foods. Researchers grouped wild strawberries
                            with
                            the top antioxidant-rich berries, which also included wild blueberries, blackberries, and
